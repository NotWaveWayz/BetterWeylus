BetterWeylus is an AutoHotkey script that provides a more convenient and user-friendly way of configuring and running [Weylus](https://github.com/H-M-H/Weylus). Weylus is a program that allows users to convert their device into a graphic tablet.

BetterWeylus provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that is more native to Windows and allows for easier customization and configuration.

## Features

* Configuring hidden (parameters only) commands.
* App settings: Users can choose to run Weylus with parameters, copy parameters to clipboard, and show a message containing parameters.
* Universal settings: Users can choose to hide the CMD prompt.
* Custom resolution/tablet area ([Active Area](https://gist.github.com/norinorin/a2d71fbf5c7085fdc47b88d3fd463ab8) & ADB (soonâ„¢) ).

## Installation

To use BetterWeylus, simply download the [.exe](https://github.com/NotWaveWayz/BetterWeylus/releases/latest/download/BetterWeylus.exe) or [.ahk](https://github.com/NotWaveWayz/BetterWeylus/releases/latest/download/BetterWeylus.ahk) (requires AutoHotkey 1.1+ to be installed; v2 will not be supported) and run it. The GUI will appear, allowing you to configure your Weylus settings. Note that Weylus must be installed on your computer for BetterWeylus to work properly.

## Notes

* BetterWeylus currently only supports a single instance of Weylus.
